# Website Style Guide Template
A template that can be used prior to developing a website to determine colors, fonts, and text styling that will be used in the site development.
## General Information
The assigned purpose of the project was to create a website design system using HTML and CSS.  
As I began completing the project, I realized that this would make a handy template for planning any styling for any new website, so before filling it in for the assignment, 
I saved these files as templates to be used again.
The project was developed for the Build A Website Design System Project, part of the Full-Stack Engineer Career Path in Codecademy.

## Setup
